(5-g.) Population increasing due to home construction activity. In this area there is no marine view, but many pine and eucalyptus trees give a park-like effect. This area is known as the Fernwood Tract; also includes Glenwood Glade. When the lack of street improvements, school facilities and transportation is overcome, this area should be classified as (A) Low Green. Many residences are owned by the California Veterans' Welfare Board and F.H.A. loans are numerous in the area. Building Inspector's Office Records, Oakland; Ralph E. Prentice June 15, 7"

Has bus line transportation; one grammar school and no high school; owing to shocking type of existing improvements and general reputation of area, it can only be graded \"D\". However, low percent of land improvements and many favorable factors indicate future prospects of better development. Large contiguous tracts of undeveloped land that can be purchased at acreage prices would seem to offer opportunity for speculation and/or resubdividing. That part of this area lying west of Edwards Avenue was seriously handicapped at the time it was subdivided and placed on the market some twelve years ago. The promoters offered a bonus of $50 worth of lumber with each lot, for the purpose of building temporary shelter. In many cases, the resulting shacks have been added to and improved until now there are many very small, poorly designed dwellings, showing little evidence of pride of ownership. Marketability is limited, values are problematical and the majority of residents have little financial responsibility. The area has been further handicapped by the installation of costly street improvements in 1930, which resulted in heavy property assessments and the subsequent loss of many lots and homes. These street improvements resulted in a scandal, involving several city officials. The bonds which were issued in payment, were sold for as little as twenty cents on the dollar and land values sank to the vanishing point. During the depression there were many foreclosures in this area and a large percentage of vacant houses. Recovery has been slow in a large part of the district. The city owns a reservoir site west of Tiller Avenue and south of Mountain Boulevard. The section east of this reservoir is sparsely settled and gives promise of developing into a higher grade area.

Very few sales in 1933 and practically no houses rented. Zoned first residential. North and east of this area is a vacant tract which is now being platted and improved for a subdivision, which when occupied, will undoubtedly be a High Blue. This area has great charm and one of the most active sections of the East Bay area. It may easily develop in an \"A\" Low Green area. Ray L. Billings, Realtor and present Mayor of San Leandro; Paul A. Pacheco, Realtor, San Leandro; City of San Leandro Inspection Department; Ralph E. Prentice; Edw. J. Johnson. June 15, 7"

Was subdivided and practically built up in 1927-1928. There were many building and loan foreclosures in the area, with consequent big decline in sales prices. There has been considerable recent building activity from funds provided mainly by F.H.A. The area is zoned first residential; the industrial area immediately south, was formerly occupied by Durant Motor Company. Now is operated by the Chevrolet Motor Company as a truck assembly plant. This is considered a beneficial influence, rather than otherwise. Edw. J. Johnson of L. Johnson & Sons, City of Oakland, Building Inspector's Office; Ralph E. Prentice June 15,  7"
