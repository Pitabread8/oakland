# Oakland
Kode with Klossy x Black Wealth Data Center Data Storytelling Challenge - Award Winner

## About
Oakland Unscrolled is a storytelling project about redlining in Oakland, California. I made it as a part of the KWK x BWDC challenge, and used Svelte, Scrollama, Leaflet, d3, and Animate on Scroll Library. I haven't used Svelte in a long time, so I had to get used to it; and I'd never used scrollama, leaflet, and d3 before, so it was a challenge to make everything fit together seamlessly. I also had to ensure the scroller components fit for certain screen sizes. I'm less intimidated by d3 now and look forward to using it for more data visualizations in the future!
