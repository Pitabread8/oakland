            <p>Start by educating yourself. What discriminatory policies existed historically in your area? Look into data and trends about demographics today, collected by organizations like <a href="https://blackwealthdata.org/" target="_blank" class="underline text-red-400 underline-offset-4">Black Wealth Data Center</a>. What multitude of factors created the disparities you see around you? This includes redlining, as well as communities replaced by new development projects and freeways. Help build awareness of these issues in your community. Then, look towards helping marginalized groups build wealth. Support black businesses! Finally, each out to your local government officials asking them to take large-scale actions.</p>
